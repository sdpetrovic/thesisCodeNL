 *    Changelog
 *      YYMMDD    Author            Comment
 *      100906    J. Melman         First creation of code.
 *      110124    K. Kumar          Split into .h and .cpp files.
 *      110629    F.M. Engelen      Added specific gas constants.
 *      120127    D. Dirkx          Moved to Tudat core, removed variables related to
 *                                  obliquity of ecliptic.
 *      120203    K. Kumar          Added missing specific gas constant value; need unit test.
 *      121212    K. Kumar          Migrated namespace to directory-based protocol and added
 *                                  backwards compatibility.
 *      130111    D. Dirkx          Added Planck, Boltzmann, and Stefan-Boltzmann constants.
